# cypress7030

* Excercises are in the file cypress/integration/suite.js
* There is a folder "examples" inside cypress/integration where you can find some code examples of differents actions
* First thing to do should be "npm install", cypress can take some time to download
* Inside cypress/support/selectors.js are some of the selectors you should use to complete the excercises. Feel free to add anyone missing.
* "npm run cypress" should open the cypress GUI
* Once running a test using the cypress GUI modifying any file should trigger a rerun of the open test.
